# Week 1 Homework

## Description

The main purpose of this project is to highlight the basic functions of HTML and CSS through a webpage design that meets accessibility standards.

The basic functions of Html shown in this project is mainly about assigning semantic HTML elements, ensuring the HTML elements follow a logical structure, providing "alt codes" to images, and giving each element a specific id or class.  

As for the basic CSS functions, the concepts shown here are to correct and rearrange the CSS codes, so that the codes are more concise and are refrencing the respective elements in the HTML file.  

Going through the project allowed me to pinpoint the universal elements, image elements, and the organization and flow of the HTML and CSS files.  I am able give a clear and concise HTML and its respective CSS for anyone reading the them. 

## Installation

With the given code for Horiseon's webpage, there are some problems present that can occlude when reading through the code.  There are portion of the HTML code were missing specific elements such as alt codes, sementic classes, and a descritive title.  In addition, the CSS file also included repetitive designs for each specific element shown on the webpage.

To fix the problem, I had first added descriptive alt codes to ensure anyone viewing the website will be able to see the image description if the images do not load properly.

Secondly, I have replaced any universal element types with specific element types like "p", "article", "nav", etc.  By replacing the universal element types, people reading the code will have an easier time outlining the entire HTML code.  

Thirdly, the organization of the headers and elements needs to follow logical order.  While going through the prmopt, I found no issues with the headers' and the elements' order, since they proceed from largest header to smaller headers and the elements from title to body to footer.  

As for the CSS file, I had grouped several repetitive designs into one, which allows the readers to have an easier time reading through the file.  With more repetitive syntax, there are more chances for mistakes.
